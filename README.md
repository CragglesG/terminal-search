# Terminal Search

Terminal Search is a command-line application that allows users to search the internet using [Exa](https://exa.ai). It's built in Python using [Textual](https://textualize.io).

## How to Use

While Terminal Search is designed to be a command-line application, it's also available online at [https://textual-web.io/craig/terminal-search](https://textual-web.io/craig/terminal-search). If you want to use it in the terminal, you can install it using pipx:

```bash
pipx install terminal-search
```

Make sure to set the environment variable `EXA_API_KEY` to your [Exa](https://exa.ai) API key before running it using the command:

```bash
terminal-search
```

> [!NOTE]
> You may encounter styling issues when using Terminal Search over SSH.
